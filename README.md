# SetsnReps 🏋️‍♂️📲

**SetsnReps** is a workout tracking app (inspired by Hevy), built using .NET 8 and Blazor WebAssembly.  
The entire project is being documented through a YouTube series on [@dotnetOnTap](https://www.youtube.com/@dotnetOnTap), where we combine .NET, coding, beer, fitness, and more.
